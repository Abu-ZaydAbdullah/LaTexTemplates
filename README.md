# LaTex Templates
This repository houses all the template files I utilize for all my LaTeX-based writing and presentation creation. As of right now it contains a US Paper, an article and a Beamer template. However, more templates are in the works.

**Note:** To get the most out of these templates use them with [Neovim](https://neovim.io) and the [vim-latex plugin](https://github.com/vim-latex/vim-latex). These two together along with a [few simple keymaps](https://github.com/Abu-ZaydAbdullah/LaTexTemplates/blob/Personal/LaTex.vim) can drastically speed up your writing and just make your work with LaTeX easier.
